# Case Study: Special Diet Classification
We are what we eat. Science and literature suggest that nutritional intakes have more impact on fitness and weight control than exercise alone. This case study aims to experiment with a series of machine learning models to effectively analyze and classify particular diet types among a large set of recipes to help people on special diets identify the most suitable dishes to accomplish their diverse dietary objectives.

## Objective
Help <b><i>people on special diets</i></b> quickly identify the most suitable dishes by analyzing recipe ingredients.

## Methodology
1. Prepare
2. Build
3. Deliver
